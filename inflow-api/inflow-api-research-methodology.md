# Inflow Inventory API Research Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology used to extract comprehensive API collection information from Inflow Inventory's API documentation when direct Swagger/OpenAPI specification access was not available.

## Challenge
The primary challenge was that the official API documentation at `https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/docs/index.html` uses Redoc (a dynamic documentation renderer) that loads API specifications from a referenced `swagger.json` file, which was not directly accessible.

## Research Strategy

### 1. Initial Direct Access Attempts
**What was tried:**
- Direct access to main documentation URL
- Attempted to access swagger.json at various paths:
  - `https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/docs/swagger.json`
  - `https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/api/swagger.json`
  - `https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/swagger.json`

**Result:** All attempts returned 404 errors or only showed Redoc initialization JavaScript

### 2. Web Search Strategy
**Search Query Used:**
```
Inflow Inventory API documentation collections endpoints swagger openapi site:inflowinventory.com
```

**Key Findings:**
- Found official support documentation
- Located GitHub repository with API examples
- Discovered Airbyte connector documentation (most valuable source)

### 3. Alternative Documentation Sources

#### A. Official Support Documentation
**URL:** `https://www.inflowinventory.com/support/cloud/inflows-api`

**Information Extracted:**
- API authentication requirements (API key + Company ID)
- Base URL pattern: `https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/{companyId}/endpoint`
- Confirmed collections: Sales Orders, Customers, Products, Vendors
- API features: filtering, pagination, includes parameter

#### B. GitHub Repository
**URL:** `https://github.com/ArchonSystemsInc/inflow_api_examples`

**Information Extracted:**
- Confirmed API exists and is actively used
- Basic CRUD operations mentioned (create, retrieve, update products)
- References back to official documentation

#### C. Airbyte Connector Documentation (Primary Source)
**URL:** `https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/inflowinventory`

**Why This Was Most Valuable:**
- Airbyte connectors require comprehensive knowledge of available API endpoints
- Listed all 19 available collections/streams
- Provided technical details about data structure
- Confirmed authentication requirements

**Complete Collections List Extracted:**
1. adjustment reasons
2. categories
3. currencies
4. customers
5. locations
6. operation types
7. payment terms
8. pricing schemes
9. products
10. product cost adjustments
11. purchase orders
12. sales orders
13. stock adjustments
14. stock counts
15. stock transfers
16. tax codes
17. taxing schemes
18. team members
19. vendors

## Endpoint Pattern Analysis

Based on REST API conventions and the information gathered, I inferred the following patterns:

### Read-Only Collections (GET only)
Most collections follow this pattern:
- `GET /{companyId}/collection-name` - List all items
- `GET /{companyId}/collection-name/{itemId}` - Get specific item

### Full CRUD Collections
Major business entities support full CRUD operations:
- `GET /{companyId}/collection-name`
- `GET /{companyId}/collection-name/{itemId}`
- `POST /{companyId}/collection-name`
- `PATCH /{companyId}/collection-name/{itemId}`
- `DELETE /{companyId}/collection-name/{itemId}`

**Collections with Full CRUD:**
- Customers
- Products
- Purchase Orders
- Sales Orders
- Vendors

## Documentation URL Pattern
All documentation URLs follow the pattern:
```
https://cloudapi.inflowinventory.com/docs/index.html#/Collection%20Name
```

Where spaces in collection names are URL encoded as `%20`.

## Key Insights for Future Research

### 1. Third-Party Integration Documentation
When official API docs are not accessible, check:
- Data integration platforms (Airbyte, Zapier, etc.)
- ETL/ELT service providers
- Integration marketplace listings

### 2. Developer Community Resources
- GitHub repositories with API examples
- Stack Overflow discussions
- Developer forum posts

### 3. Official Support Documentation
- Often contains high-level API information
- May reference specific endpoints or features
- Usually includes authentication details

### 4. Web Search Strategies
**Effective search patterns:**
- `[service name] API documentation collections endpoints`
- `site:[domain] API swagger openapi`
- `[service name] API integration examples`

## Validation Methods

### 1. Cross-Reference Sources
- Compare information across multiple sources
- Look for consistency in endpoint names and patterns
- Verify authentication requirements match across sources

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Apply REST API conventions
- Infer CRUD operations based on business logic
- Use similar APIs as reference points

### 3. Logical Grouping
- Group related endpoints into collections
- Ensure collection names match business domain

## Tools Used

### WebFetch
- Primary tool for accessing documentation pages
- Used with specific prompts to extract API information
- Effective for parsing both technical docs and support pages

### WebSearch
- Essential for discovering alternative information sources
- Used targeted search queries with site restrictions
- Helped identify the most comprehensive data sources

## Replication Steps for Other APIs

1. **Direct Access Attempt**
   - Try to access swagger.json or openapi.json directly
   - Check common paths: `/docs/swagger.json`, `/api/docs`, `/swagger.json`

2. **Alternative Source Research**
   - Search for third-party integration documentation
   - Look for official support/developer pages
   - Check GitHub for API examples or SDKs

3. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Apply REST conventions to infer missing endpoints
   - Cross-reference with similar APIs in the same domain
   - Validate assumptions against available information

4. **Documentation Creation**
   - Structure findings in a consistent format
   - Include source URLs for verification
   - Document assumptions and inferences clearly

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage:** Identified all 19 API collections
- **Accuracy:** Followed standard REST patterns
- **Completeness:** Included all standard CRUD operations where applicable
- **Structure:** Matched requested JSON format exactly
- **Validation:** Cross-referenced multiple independent sources

## Future Improvements
1. Try accessing the API with valid credentials to confirm endpoint availability
2. Test actual endpoints to validate HTTP methods
3. Examine response schemas to understand data structures
4. Document rate limits and pagination details
5. Identify webhook or real-time API capabilities
